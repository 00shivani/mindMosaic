#  mindMosaic

## Description 

Mind Mosaic is an app for curation as opposed to creation. Unlike most social media platforms that allow users to post their lifestyle updates, Mind Mosaic allows users to piece together all the content they find interesting in a gallery format. User profiles will resemble a mosaic of their mind and all their niche interests and preferences.
